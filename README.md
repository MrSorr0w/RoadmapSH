# Introduction

My goal here is to get a sense of what it's like to build entry-level (but functional) backend projects while also learning new programming languages, APIs, databases, and possibly some DSA (check out the "hands-on" repository for more).

## Subdirectories

Each subdirectory is based on a "role-based roadmap" and "skill-based roadmap", in which they include projects related to that particular subfield of knowledge (e.g. Backend Developer contains programs like "Weather API" or "E-Commerce Platform").
